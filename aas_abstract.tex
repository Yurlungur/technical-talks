\begin{abstract}

  The 2017 detection of the in-spiral and merger of two neutron stars
  was a landmark discovery in astrophysics. Through a wealth of
  multi-messenger data, we now know that the merger of these
  ultracompact stellar remnants is a central engine of short gamma ray
  bursts and a site of r-process nucleosynthesis, where the heaviest
  elements in our universe are formed. The radioactive decay of
  unstable heavy elements produced in such mergers powers an optical
  and infra-red transient: The kilonova.

  A key tool in understanding this observation---and the wealth of
  observations we expect going forward---is the forward-modeling of
  the merger and its aftermath. This forward modeling requires many
  inputs, including general relativity, magnetohydrodynamics, weak
  interacitons, nuclear reaction rates and atomic emissivities and
  opacities. In this talk, I discuss how this modeling is done, from
  end to end, with an emphasis on uncertainties and the role that
  laboratory astrophysics plays in our understanding and modeling of
  these observations. I also present recent progress in modeling one
  key aspect of the system, the accretion disk formed around the
  compact remnant.
